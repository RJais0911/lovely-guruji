A frontend web developer works with the frontend i.e., the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website.

A backend web developer works with the backend i.e., working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website, basically working with application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.

A full stack developer is the one who does the work of both the front end and the backend developer.

How to get started?

Step1: Front-End

1. HTML –

Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is used to create the basic structure of a website.

It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

2. CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. It provides the style to our html webpage.

3. JAVASCRIPT

After the structure and styling of the web page is done, now comes the step where we add logic to our webpage. This is done with the help of the popular programming language JavaScript.

Step 2: Frameworks

After learning the basics of frontend development comes the part where we get to know about how to use libraries and frameworks. This makes our works get done in less time and more efficiently.

There are popular frame work for CSS which makes styling very easy some of them are-

1. Tailwind CSS

2. Bootstrap

3. Foundation

4. Bulma

5. Skelton

I personally prefer tailwind CSS the most.

Now comes frameworks for JavaScript. Some of the popular ones are –

1. React js

2. Angular

3. Vue js

As a beginner I would recommend you to go with react.

Step 3: Back-end

Now comes getting started with the backend.

For the backend you can go with anyone you want, but as a personal recommendation I would prefer you to go with mongo.

1. Mongo DB

2. Django

3. Flask

You can also use headless CMS to make your work even easier.

Some popular headless CMS are –

1. Sanity

2. Strapi

3. Butter

Step 4: APIs and authentication

Build projects and learn how to work with different APIs and authentication.

Step 5: Source Control

Learn about source control. Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code.

For this you need to learn git and GitHub.

Step 6: Hosting

For the hosting purposes you can use various services like vercel, netlify, etc. Its very easy to use. You can also use a custom domain if you want to.

This was all you needed. Wish you luck on your web development journey :)
